## Acknowledgements

This project would not be possible without octaviusz, someone working on Zen folders, and the dev of the base JS (ATG uses a modified version) for the mod. Please go give him a follow and star. 

_His code was used with consent, but he needs more credit. I may rename the project to include his name._

## Notice

The pinned tab support is partially working but not easy or consistent, this will be updated soon for full pinned tab support.

**How to use Pinned Tab Folders:**

1. Move desigred Tab (NOT TABS PLURAL!) to the pinned tab section
2. right click and hit "Add Tab to Group" (This will move it down to the normal tab section)
3. Drag the folder up to the disired spot in the pinned tab section
4. Add the rest of your desigred tabs to the new pinned folder (it will save across restart)
  

## Setup

Advanced Tab Groups is made for [Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine)! Please follow these steps to install the Mod.

1. Go to the [Sine releases](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine/releases) and download the auto-installer for your system from the latest stable build of the Mod Manager.

2. Run the auto-installer as an admin and follow the instructions that are prompted.

3. Open Zen and go to `about:preferences#sineMods`.

4. Install Advanced Tab Groups from the Mod Store

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. If you are unable to run programs as an admin on your computer, you will be unable to install, as Sine modifies your Zen directory to install [fx-autoconfig](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig) 
>
> 2. You may have to go to `about:support` and clear your startup cache if you do not see Sine in `about:preferences`

## Configuration Options  

These prefs can be configured within the Sine UI after installation:  

- **`tab.groups.add-arrow`**  
- **`tab.groups.background`**  
- **`tab.groups.borders`**  
- **`tab.groups.display-tab-range`**
